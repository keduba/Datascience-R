# Datascience-R

This repo holds datascience projects, examples and tools done in the R language.

`dsbox` is based on the wonderful [datasciencebox.org](https://datasciencebox.org) project by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel.

In it, I work with the `tidyverse` packages as an approach to data wrangling, statistics and modelling.
